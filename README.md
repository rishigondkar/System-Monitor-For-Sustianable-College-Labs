# Sustainable College Labs: 
- Developed a distributed system of computers along with a desktop application that tracks user’s activity and machine’s power
consumption.
- The Project also involved creating a webpage to monitor and control (sleep / shutdown / logoff) all the PCs of a college from a
single screen.
- All the monitoring is done remotely through a MObile Application.
